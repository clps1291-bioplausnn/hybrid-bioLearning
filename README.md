# PyTorch Implementation of “Unsupervised learning by competing hidden units” MNIST classifier
This reprository is a PyTorch implementation of the paper ["Unsupervised learning by competing hidden units"](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/16/7723). By Dmitry Krotov and John J. Hopfield.

We also very brielfy explore adversarial robustness of models implemented with this method.

Thanks to both original authors for such a unique and fascinating area of exploration.
